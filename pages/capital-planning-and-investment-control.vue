                            Effective management of capital resources is essential for organizations aiming to make informed decisions about technology investments. Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a structured process that ensures IT investments align with an organization’s strategic goals while optimizing performance and managing risk. By integrating CPIC into your operational strategy, you gain the ability to prioritize investments that drive the most value, while maintaining transparency and accountability. Are your IT investments delivering measurable outcomes, or are you facing inefficiencies and wasted resources?
